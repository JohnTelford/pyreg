website-development-stack.md:	The key *Iterative Development* technologies are [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for command and control, [MkDocs Marteral](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) static site generator, [GitHub](git-github#github), [git](git-github#git), and a [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) like [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com)
website-development-stack.md:A solution to this problem is to have one central repository controlled by a team member gatekeeper. Each team member [forks](git-github#fork) a copy of central project repository to their GetHub account and makes a [clone](glossary#clone) of it on their workstation.
website-development-stack.md:- Each developer makes changes to their repository [clone](glossary#clone). They cannot directly make changes to the central repository.
website-development-stack.md:	- They may deploy their local repository to a private [Preview](deploy#preview) Internet website for stakeholders to see and give feedback. 
website-development-stack.md:- The process is managed using [GitHub for Teams](https://github.com/team). When stakeholders determine developers changes, defect fixes, or new features are ready, a GitHub [Pull Request](git-github#pull-request) is made by developers to the central project repository. 
website-development-stack.md:	- Project team members and the gatekeeper are notified by GitHub of the [Pull Request](git-github#pull-request) request. They may examine, comment on, suggest possible changes, and test the code. 
website-development-stack.md:	- Iterations of the central project repository may be deployed by the gatekeeper to a private [Preview](deploy#preview)  for stakeholders viewing. 
website-development-stack.md:- The next step is each developer [Pulls](git-github#pull) the central repository changes and commits them to their local repository copy of the central project. This process keeps team members up to date on changes.
